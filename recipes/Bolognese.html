<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A slow-simmered, chunky ground beef, bacon, and pork Bolognese sauce with lots of vegetables and herbs.<br>
    "Wonderful flavors!" says home cook studioworks. <br>
    "I made a double batch and I'm glad I did; it will be well worth pulling from the freezer when needed."</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, minced</li>
    <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes</li>
    <li>½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>6 ounces tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 carrots, shredded</li>
    <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
    <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 pound pasta</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion, bacon, and 
         in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes.  
        Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined
         plate to drain; set aside.</li>
         <br>
    <li>Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. 
        Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 
        5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, 
            celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture.
             Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, 
             stirring occasionally.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Serve sauce over hot pasta.</li>   
        <br>
